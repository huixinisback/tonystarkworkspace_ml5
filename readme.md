## How to Play

Interact with the virtual environment using just your fingers and gestures tracked via webcam:

### 🟦 Create a Box
- **Touch the tip of your index finger and middle finger together**.
- A new box will appear at your finger location.

### ❌ Remove a Box
- **Touch the tip of your thumb to any existing box**.
- The box will be deleted immediately.

### 🤏 Move a Box
- **Touch the tip of your thumb and middle finger together while touching a box**.
- The box will follow your hand as long as the gesture is held.

Built using `p5.js`, `p5play`, and `ml5.js` for gesture-controlled interaction.
